**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many excercies on FreeCodeCamp.

### [SKIP]: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress** I was bedridden all day today. No coding today but focusing on recovering and being 100%. This will be my one and only skip/cheat day where I don't code.

**Thoughts:** Although I didn't code, I listened to some audio books I downloaded online. I've already read Don Norman's "Design of Everyday Things" but listening to the audio book is a whole other experience.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress** Today I continued with FreeCodeCamps tutorials. I will try to finish "Responsive Design with Bootstrap and hope to begin jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I'm beginning to appreciate the bootstrap library. It's heavy with awesome designs that at times I overlook in my everyday browse of the internet. Combined with listening to DOET (Design of Everyday Things) I really am liking this whole front-end development.
